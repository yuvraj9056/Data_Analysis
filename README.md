# Uber Ride Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Uber ride data to discover patterns related to ride demand, popular pickup and dropoff locations, fare trends, and time-based usage. The analysis provides key insights into when and where Uber rides are most frequent, how fares vary with distance and time of day, and which areas have the highest demand. This information can be useful for optimizing ride allocation and improving pricing strategies.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed the dataset, converting timestamps and extracting features like hour, day, and day of the week.
- **Peak Time Analysis**: Identified the busiest hours and days for Uber rides using visualizations.
- **Location Analysis**: Mapped frequent pickup and dropoff locations based on latitude and longitude.
- **Fare and Distance Analysis**: Explored the relationship between trip distance and fare amount.
- **Visualizations**: Provided easy-to-understand graphs for peak time analysis, location analysis, and fare trends.
